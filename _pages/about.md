I currently work in wave propagation simulations using Maxwell solvers. Previously, I worked as a Scientific Software Engineer at [Rayfos](https://www.rayfos.com/). Before joining RayFos, I was a Researcher with the Biomedical Photonic Imaging Group at the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/). Prior to that, I was a Researcher at the Indian Institute of Science ([IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/)), Bangalore, Karnataka, India, working with [Prof. Kusala Rajendran](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=MA7H8t8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/). In July 2020, I completed my master’s in Earth Sciences from IISc. Before that, I completed my bachelor’s in Civil Engineering from [Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/), Pune, Maharashtra, India.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
